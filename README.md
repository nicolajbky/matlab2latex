# matlab2latex
These files have been created during my time as a PHD student at the Hamburg University of Technology. 
Since I was developing a lot of my work in MATLAB and SIMULINK and I currently write my thesis in LaTeX, I have to constantly convert data from MATLAB to a usable format for LaTeX.
Since I have spent too many hours searching for some code that will do exactly what I need and I couldn't find it, I startet programming my own functions.

This is the result (and there will be more to come).

Please feel free to share and comment on it.
Not everything might be totally new but maybe someone can find some value in it.

Cheers,
Nicolaj
